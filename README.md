# Venue-Tickets-Project
Created in Freshman Year. This was the final project in my Intro to Programming and Logic class using VisualBasic. Created a program that displays an interactive map of the venue to the user and allows them to select and purchase their desired seats directly from it. A description of the project can be found in the Project Proposal file. 
Main code file found in VenueProject > VenueProject > VenueProject.vb
